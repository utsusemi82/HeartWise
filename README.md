## 🧠 Project Overview

HeartWise is a final year data science project focused on detecting stress levels using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) analysis. It leverages physiological signals to classify stress states using machine learning algorithms, presented in an interactive and accessible web application via Streamlit.

This project supports mental health awareness by providing a low-cost, data-driven way to help users track and manage stress.

## 📊 Features

- 🩺 HRV feature extraction from RR interval datasets
- 📉 Exploratory Data Analysis and preprocessing
- 🧠 Multiple classification models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest)
- 🧪 Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- 🎯 Interactive Streamlit app for real-time predictions
- 📎 Supporting documentation: proposal & final presentation decks

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit for web-based UI
- Google Colab for prototyping
